# My 2021 code
In 2021, along with my Dad, I followed tutorials from a Basher book and hosted the websites I created using those tutorials with [000webhost,](https://www.000webhost.com/) a now dead website hosting service.
Luckily enough, I still had a local copy of the code I made following the tutorials in that Basher book, so three years later I decided to put it in GitHub, because why not?! Also, since 000webhost is closing now, they killed all hosted websites (including mine), so I can't access the live versions anymore. I can always deploy them again using GitHub Pages, but that'll be another story.

**❌ PHP's do not work properly because no other host except 000webhost (dead), Hostinger, and other paid alternatives support PHP usage, so if you would like to use the PHP's either download them all or download all of the source code, please.**
